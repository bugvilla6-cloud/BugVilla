        The legend stated that the Atreides family came from a noble family that originated in Greece on Earth, and that they rose to prominence during the Butlerian Jihad. House Atreides specifically claimed descent from King Agamemnon, a son of Atreus, in Greek mythology. The descendants of Atreus are called "Atreides" (plural "Atreidai", Latinized as "Atreidae") in the Greek language. This Royal House included many significant figures in Greek myth.

      <h2 id="homeworld">Homeworld</h2>
      <p class="homeworld">
        Up until the latter days of Duke Leto Atreides I, House Atreides maintained the planetary fief of Caladan and had their center of operation on the planet, which they had also ruled for twenty generations. House Atreides had perfected a form of government that resulted in a well-organized society and a spiritually satisfied people. Furthermore, House Atreides kept Caladan a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels, in stark contrast to House Harkonnen's capital, Giedi Prime. However, the House was also proficient in war, maintaining Swordmasters, Warmasters, and Mentats to train and lead their army. House Atreides also developed its own Battle Language.

      <h3 id="downfall">Downfall & revival</h3>

      <p class="downfall">
        At the request of Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV, Duke Leto relocated his House to the desert planet Arrakis and took over mining operations of the spice melange from House Harkonnen.
      </p>

      <p class="downfall">
        However, Leto was walking into a trap set by an illegal alliance between House Harkonnen and House Corrino. Hawat and the Duke knew as much, but the time frame and scale of the ambush caught them by surprise, along with the betrayal of a trusted Suk doctor bent to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's will by Twisted Mentat Piter de Vries.
      </p>

      <p class="downfall">
        Wellington Yueh's betrayal was double-edged: he used it as an opportunity to (unsuccessfully) assassinate the Baron with a poison tooth and to orchestrate the escape of the Duke's son Paul and concubine Lady Jessica Atreides into the deep desert, where they would eventually be intercepted by a Fremen tribe led by Stilgar.
      </p>

      <p class="downfall">
        As a result of the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica assumed influence over the Fremen tribe by drinking the Water of Life — changing her unborn daughter in the process — and becoming their new Reverend Mother, while Paul took up the mantle of their prophesied Mahdi and Lisan al-Gaib.
      </p>

      <p class="downfall">
        Two years later, House Corrino was overthrown by Duke Paul Muad'Dib and his unified army of Fremen after the Padishah Emperor was drawn to Arrakis by Governor Rabban's incompetence in dealing with repeated sabotage of spice production. Through a coerced marriage with Irulan Corrino, Paul became Emperor and ruled for twelve years of galactic violence and bloodshed.
      </p>

      <p class="downfall">
        Two decades later, Paul's second-born son, Leto Atreides II, became his successor after merging with a colony of sandtrout to extend his lifespan and guarantee the Golden Path of humanity's survival. From desert to terraformed paradise, Arrakis remained the homeworld of House Atreides for thirty-five centuries until its official dissolution.
      </p>

    <section aria-labelledby="legacy">
      <h4 id="legacy">Legacy of Leto</h4>
      <p>
        In some ways, Leto lived on in his son Paul and grandson Leto II, through their possession of Other Memory. It was also partially Leto's love for Duncan Idaho that saw Leto II maintain a series of Idaho gholas throughout his reign. During both Paul's and Leto II's reigns, millions flocked to visit Leto I's shrine, since Atreides ancestry had taken on a religious mystique. More than this, Leto came to symbolize all that was good about the Atreides bloodline: courage, integrity, loyalty, justice, and honor. Had Leto survived his rule on Arrakis, he likely would have commanded similar fanaticism as his son.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite buying her from the Bene Gesserit for her clerical skills<sup id="fnref1">[1]</sup>, it was only natural for Leto to fall in love with Jessica, given her training in romance and seduction. However, Jessica's genuine love for Leto was a betrayal of the Sisterhood's values, including their strict order to give Leto a daughter and not the son he desired. This unauthorized male heir disrupted the breeding program so irreversibly that "the Jessica Crime" became a lasting warning for any Sister driven to similar temptation.

        <p>Damn the Spice! We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who's to go. But you're going, and that's an order!</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Our supremacy on Caladan depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it's possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of 'thopter shields. The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don't dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.</p>

      <h6 id="jessica"><strong>Early life of the Bene Gesserit — Jessica</strong></h6>

      <p class="jessica-early">
        A result of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Jessica was born on Wallach IX from the illegitimate union of Tanidia Nerus and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose identities were concealed according to standard Sisterhood protocol. She was raised and educated from birth by the Bene Gesserit, who intended to breed her to House Atreides heir Duke Leto and produce a daughter who would then be wed to Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Their union was intended to settle the ancient feud between both Houses and to produce the Kwisatz Haderach — a superbeing with powerful prescience and the collective genetic knowledge of all his ancestors.
      </p>

      <h6><strong>Building Jessica</strong></h6>
      <article aria-labelledby="building-jessica">
        <p id="building-jessica" class="jessica-building">
          At first the Bene Gesserit plan appeared to work perfectly. Jessica became the concubine of Duke Leto, which left him free to marry should such a union prove advantageous. However, their relationship soon grew into genuine love — a love that caused Jessica to disobey her orders and conceive a son for her Duke.
        </p>

        <p class="jessica-building"><strong>Arrakis</strong><br>
        In 10191 AG, when House Atreides was given the fiefdom of Arrakis and left their ancestral home of Caladan, Jessica moved into the Arrakeen governor's mansion with Duke Leto and Paul Atreides. Their rule was short-lived due to the treacherous alliance between House Harkonnen and the Padishah Emperor.
        </p>

        <p class="jessica-building"><strong>Reverend Mother</strong><br>
        Encouraged by Jessica's arrival and her considerable abilities, the Fremen Naib Stilgar informed her that Reverend Mother Ramallo was old and needed a successor. To establish her and Paul's place in the Fremen hierarchy, Jessica undertook the dangerous process of ingesting the Water of Life. The act of transmuting the worm's poison while absorbing Ramallo's memories elevated her to Reverend Mother status and fundamentally changed the fetus she carried, causing her daughter Alia to be born with full ancestral knowledge.
        </p>

        <p class="jessica-building">
          Nearly a decade after their birth, Jessica returned to Arrakis to observe her grandchildren for any signs of Abomination and to attempt to return control of their bloodline to the Sisterhood. During this time she discovered that Alia had become possessed by the ego-memory of Vladimir Harkonnen. To protect her from her murderous daughter, Duncan Idaho transported Jessica to Salusa Secundus, where she taught Farad'n Corrino the ways of the Bene Gesserit, unwittingly preparing him for his future roles.
        </p>

        <p class="jessica-building"><strong>Legacy</strong><br>
          Even in death, Jessica's legacy remained far-reaching. The Sisterhood attributed many universe-changing consequences — particularly the emergence of the Kwisatz Haderach and his son — to the deep love she held for Leto. Her actions became known as "the Jessica Crime" and were later cited as a lesson in restraint for the Sisterhood.

      <h6 id="aside-idaho"><strong>Fun fact about Idaho</strong></h6>
      <p>
        After Paul's ascension to the throne in 10196 AG, Duncan Idaho was returned to life as a ghola, created by the Bene Tleilax and gifted to Paul. Known as "Hayt" in his ghola incarnation, Idaho was trained as a Mentat and a Zensunni philosopher. He initially had no memory of his former life but eventually recovered his memories and returned to loyal service. Idaho is notable for appearing (in some form) across all six of Frank Herbert's original novels.
