<h1>Heading As of January 2026, Roblox is facing a surge of legal action, including dozens of lawsuits, state-level lawsuits, and a centralized federal multidistrict litigation (MDL), primarily focused on child safety, sexual exploitation, and data privacy violations.</h2>
              <br>
                 <p>Core Allegations and Issues
Failure to Protect Minors: Plaintiffs argue that despite marketing itself as safe for children, Roblox lacks sufficient safety features to prevent predators from grooming young users.
Inadequate Age Verification: Lawsuits highlight that for years,<strong> it was easy for adults to pose as children and for children to bypass safety restrictions.</strong></p>
   <p class="center-text">Financial Exploitation: Concerns have been raised about the platform's monetization, including the pressure on children to spend money on virtual items.</strong>
Data Privacy: A proposed class action alleges that Roblox violates the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by tracking child data without proper consent. </p>

State Attorney General Lawsuits: At least three states have sued Roblox, alleging the platform violates consumer protection laws by failing to protect children from predators:</p>
<p class="center-text"><h3><br> The majority of targeted children are girls, and most victimization occurs with mobile-phone support.<br> Children and teenagers who are highly curious and high-sensation-seeking are at higher risk than others.<br><p class="center-text">
Sexual predation of children on the Internet mostly consists of adults using the Internet to meet and seduce underage adolescents into sexual encounters.<br> Some abusers (sometimes posing as children themselves) chat with children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person. Internet initiated sex crimes against minors is most prevalent in relation to the 13–17 age group (99% of cases), and particularly 13–14 (48%)</h3>

<p><strong>Signs that characterize child groomers include: a person who tries to communicate with a child online or in person in <br>secret, outside the knowledge of the child's parents or guardians.<br> A person who attempts to isolate a child from their friends or family, or who discourages the child from spending time with others.<br> or a person who asks a child to keep secrets or who makes the child feel like they are special or important in a way that is inappropriate.</strong></p></hr>

<p class="center-text"><p>When grooming techniques are successful, the resulting compliance of the child can be mis-interpreted as consent; and the child treated as if they were not a victim of crime.<br> When the behavior is considered criminal, it can still be perceived as a lesser offense.</p>

<p>Some offenders prefer sexual gratification from less obvious types of behaviors, and grooming behaviors in and of <br>themselves are the goal as they provide a chance to engage in a paraphilia.</p>
